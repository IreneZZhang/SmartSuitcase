# SmartSuitcase
This project is inspired by [Autonomous Follow-me Cooler](https://www.hackster.io/hackerhouse/make-an-autonomous-follow-me-cooler-7ca8bc)

The detailed building process can be found on this website https://www.hackster.io/IreneZZhang/smart-suitcase-prototype-13291c 

In the first stage of this project, I am building an RC car controllable from a phone app, Adafruit Bluefruit LE Connect. It also features an ultrasonic sensor that detects obstacles in front of it and beeps to warn the user.
